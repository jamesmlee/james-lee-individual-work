Create new NetBeans project
-File --> New Project --> Maven --> Project from Archetype
-search and select sg-spring-mvc-archetype

Create file shells
-create result.jsp in jsp folder
-create FactorizorController.java in package with HelloController.java

Create code to let us submit data from index.jsp to the servlet, 
and have the servlet forward that data to result.jsp for display

index.jsp
-change Title, h1, h2
-create form to take inputs
            <form method="POST" action="factorNumber">
                <input type="text" name="numberToFactor"/>
                <input type="submit" value="Find Factors!!!"/>
            </form>
-Notice the value of the action attribute for our form is factorNumber, the 
URL pattern we'll associate with the controller method that will handle this request.

FactorizorController.java
-add @Controller annotation and import it
-write a method that can handle requests, returns a string that's the logical view name
-params: HttpServletRequest to see what was set on the form, model
-annotate it to tell Spring that this is the code that should be used to service a request
-put the value in the model

    @RequestMapping(value="/factorNumber", 
                    method=RequestMethod.POST)
    public String factorNumber(HttpServletRequest request, 
                               Map<String, Object> model) {
        String numberToFactor = 
                request.getParameter("numberToFactor");
        model.put("numberToFactor", numberToFactor);
        return "result";
    }

result.jsp
-change title, h1
        <p>
            You asked to factor ${numberToFactor}
        </p>
        <a href="index.jsp">Factor another one</a>


Implement the Algorithm
=======================
-do what's needed, then ...
-set results in the model so they are available to result.jsp
        model.put("numberToFactor", numberToFactor);
        model.put("factors", factorList);
        model.put("isPrime", isPrime);
        model.put("isPerfect", isPerfect);


Display Results
===============
-add taglib directive to top of result.jsp; do NOT need to go to POM
	<%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" %>
