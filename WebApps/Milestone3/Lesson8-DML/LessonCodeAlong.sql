Since a cohort with id 2 does not exist, the database will reject the query.

Change the CohortID value from a 2 to a 1 and the query will work properly.

/*
This is one of the ways relational databases protect you from creating bad data. 
ApprenticeCohort table requires a CohortID and the FK constraint requires that 
CohortID exist in the Cohort table. This is called referential integrity.
