Hey guys, forgot yesterday to put this on Slack. This was the way that I was able to select dynamically 
generated html elements and add event handlers to them.




$(document).on('click', '.vendingmachine-item', function() {
   
	var id = this.dataset.id;
 
	setSelection(id);
 });



"on" provides a way to do this. An ancestor element to the dynamic elements is chosen (document), 
and then to "on" you pass the parameters event type (click), a selection for the elements that need 
handlers (here, my own class "vendingmachine-item"), and finally the function you're writing 
(in this case, I just "save" the chosen item number and give it to another function that displays it)
